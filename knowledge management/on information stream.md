<h2>Principles of absorbing new information</h2>

1. limit sources of information streams to lower switch costs.
2. relevant information to a high portion (>90%), the less distractions, the better. 
3. quality: something that is worth-knowing, worth trying out, worth sharing with others.
4. easy to capture and organise for later processing,

<h2>Main workspaces for information streams</h2>

1. bookmarks bar on chrome
2. raindrop serving as knowledge base
3. instapaper for saving articles (less useful now)
4. newsletters on email clients
5. twitter stream
6. reddit stream
7. blogs from research teams
8. posts shared on slack
9. podcasts

<h2>Current tensions on information acquisition</h2>

1. information streams types were scattered
2. a lot of 'seems good' posts on social media turn out do not give much value (clickbait, or simply poorly written)
3. many attractive information is out of current domain knowledge
4. some articles will no longer be accessible because they are protect by paid content policy of medium

<h2>Ideas to change the status quo</h2>

1. categorise information streams to be under a few click actions:
    - on chrome bookmark bar, it should include key entry(s) to access a master stream; somewhere should help me review the new information
2. grouping 'feed browsing' as one activity
3. define 'new information'- that can be literally news and trends, or that can be something new to me. the important point is that how should I do with these, like tagging with a project idea or learning domain.
