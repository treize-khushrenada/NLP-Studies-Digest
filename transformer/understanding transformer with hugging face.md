### transformers on hugging face
hugging face provided a library for us to use, based on recently research accompliements regarding a mechanism in machine learning. the core component, the 'transformer', unlike recurrent neural network which has to iterate over each element of the input sequence one by one, it can look at every position in the sequence at the same time. this library itself is a community-based repo to train, use and share models based on tranformer architecture variations.

With these models, this library can be used for a large variety of downstream-tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question answering etc.
