farming- an analogy

your team made a farm and invited people to 'work together'. for every request, you rejected, claiming that your team would not open that section for farming. maybe because the upper management gave you a production target which may force you to reserve the sections to grow more plants. or you simply feel like your team can keep growing on your own, at least entity-wise, so opening apis does not align your 'ambitious business plan'. at the end of the day, the guests went away, no resources were put on the section, no one really wanted the plants you grew, and you started looking for awards to justify how great your farm is.
